# 03 – Odd/Even Checker (Conditionals)

**Goal:** Practice conditionals by detecting whether a number is odd or even.
**Modes:** 
- Console (Node): `oddEven.js`
- Browser UI: `index.html + script.js`

**Inputs to test:** -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 101, 1.5, "abc"

##  What I Learned 

- **Conditionals** control the program flow by checking if a number is even, odd, or invalid.  
- **Validation** is essential: using `Number()` and `Number.isInteger()` filters out invalid or decimal inputs.  
- **Reusability:** the same `parityOf()` logic powers both the console version and the browser version.  
- **User Experience:** adding `Enter` key detection, a `Clear` button, and color-coded results makes the app feel professional.  
- **Range logic (`a..b`):** parsing a string range like `-3..3` with a regex taught me how loops and conditions can dynamically generate results.  
- **Clean UI:** a small CSS redesign can drastically improve how approachable and readable an app feels.  
- **Takeaway:** every new feature was another branch of logic, design, and debugging — each commit made me *understand* JS more deeply, not just code it.
