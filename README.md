## ⚙️ Structure

Each project folder contains:
- A single `index.js` or `app.js` file  
- Optional HTML/CSS if UI-based  
- Step-by-step commits showing concept mastery

## 📚 Projects Summary

### 🧮 Project 02 – Basic Calculator

**Date:** Nov 1, 2025  
**Concepts:** Variables, conditionals, switch statements, modular functions.  
**Highlights:**
- Core logic fully modularized.
- Clean console interface with user input simulation.

**Reflection:**  
I learned how to design a system of reusable logic blocks. Each calculation branch acts as a separate module, just like functions in larger applications.

### 🔢 Project 03 – Odd/Even Checker (UI Edition)

**Date:** Nov 2, 2025  
**Concepts:** Conditionals, modular thinking, DOM logic, validation.  
**Highlights:**
- Console logic evolved into a browser UI app.
- Added instant feedback, reset button, and input guards.
- Introduced CSS for a clean visual layer.

**Reflection:**  
Translating code to UI taught me how JavaScript interacts with the DOM — every action can trigger logic, giving programs "life" through user events.

### 🌡️ Project 04 – Temperature Converter

**Date:** Nov 3, 2025  
**Concepts:** Bi-directional syncing, event listeners, validation, UX polish.  
**Highlights:**
- Real-time two-way updates across Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.
- Absolute-zero validation + aria-live user messages.
- Enter/Esc keyboard shortcuts and auto-focus select.

**Reflection:**  
This project showed how small details like keyboard shortcuts and validation transform a script into a real user experience.

### ✖️ Project 05 – Multiplication Table Generator

**Date:** Nov 4, 2025  
**Concepts:** Loops, dynamic HTML generation, table rendering, input validation.  
**Highlights:**
- Interactive table generation with customizable number and range.
- Dynamic HTML string building using loops.
- Responsive table design with hover effects and animations.
- Enter key support and real-time input validation.

**Reflection:**  
This project deepened my understanding of loops and dynamic content generation. Building HTML strings programmatically showed me how JavaScript can construct entire UI elements on the fly. The hover effects and transitions also reinforced how CSS and JS work together to create polished, interactive experiences.
