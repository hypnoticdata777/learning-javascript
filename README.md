# learning-javascript

Daily JavaScript learning journey (fundamentals → mastery).  
Each folder = one lesson/day. Goal: consistency, clarity, progression.

## Structure

## Daily Rules
- ⏱️ **1+ commit per day** (small wins count)
- 🧩 Each lesson gets its **own folder**
- 📝 Commit messages: `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `fix:`
- 📌 Keep code runnable with `node <file>.js`

## Progress
- **Day 01:** Hello World
- **Day 02:** Variables (let/const, types)
- **Day 03:** Functions (params, return)
- **Day 04:** Conditionals (if/else, switch)
- **Day 05:** Loops (for, while, for...of)

## How to run
```bash
cd 01-hello-world
node index.js
